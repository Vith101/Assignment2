        Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style as follows.

        - Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.
        - Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.
        In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style.
        - Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.
        - Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.
        - Precast fins for sun protection, as above.
        - Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.

        The building generally appears to be in fair to good condition. A number of changes have been made which diminish its integrity including:

        - the replacement of the original glass pavilion with the current north wing, albeit with a sympathetic design;
        - the non-original window-mounted airconditioners which detract from the south elevation;
        - many of the interior fitouts appear to have been modernised; and
        - there are a number of non-original surface mounted conduits internally.

        None the less, the building retains substantial components and details of the original design.
