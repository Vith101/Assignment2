            <h2>Stylistic Analysis</h2>

            <p>Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style as follows.
                <ul>
                    <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                    <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style.
                <ul>
                    <li>Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.</li>
                    <li>Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
                    <li>Precast fins for sun protection, as above.</li>
                    <li>Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The building generally appears to be in fair to good condition. A number of changes have been made which diminish its integrity including:
                <ul>
                    <li>the replacement of the original glass pavilion with the current north wing, albeit with a sympathetic design;</li>
                    <li>the non-original window-mounted airconditioners which detract from the south elevation;</li>
                    <li>many of the interior fitouts appear to have been modernised; and</li>
                    <li>there are a number of non-original surface mounted conduits internally.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>None the less, the building retains substantial components and details of the original design.</p>
